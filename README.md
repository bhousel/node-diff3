## node-diff3

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/bhousel/node-diff3.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

This is a node.js library for text diffing and three-way-merge.

It originally came from project Synchrotron, created by Tony Garnock-Jones.

### Usage

* **patch: function (file, patch)**

  Applies a patch to a file.

  Given file1 and file2, diff.patch(file1,
  diff.diffPatch(file1, file2)) should give file2.

* **diffIndices: function(file1, file2)**

  We apply the LCS to give a simple representation of the
  offsets and lengths of mismatched chunks in the input
  files. This is used by diff3MergeIndices below.

* **diff3MergeIndices: function (a, o, b)**

  Given three files, A, O, and B, where both A and B are
  independently derived from O, returns a fairly complicated
  internal representation of merge decisions it's taken. The
  interested reader may wish to consult

* **diff3Merge: function (a, o, b, excludeFalseConflicts)**

  Applies the output of diff.diff3MergeIndices to actually
  construct the merged file; the returned result alternates
  between "ok" and "conflict" blocks.

* **merge: function (a, o, b)**

  build a merge file.

* **mergeDigIn: function (a, o, b)**

  build a digin style merge file.
